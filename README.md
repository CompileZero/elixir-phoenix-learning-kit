# Elixir & Phoenix - Zero to Hero

# Why this Repo?

Lack of good resources online. The current documentation is difficult to understand. Nobody has a clear roadmap as to how to progress in the Elixir-Phoenix Journey. Most people don't know if Phoenix is the right choice for them. This repo provides the roadmap, main concept guides, cheatsheets, project based learning, and important resources along the way.
