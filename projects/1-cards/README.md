# Cards

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/cards](https://hexdocs.pm/cards).

Elixir is a purely functional programming language

#### A module is a collection of different methods or functions

To run an elixir file : use command: iex -S mix (iex - interactive elixir shell)

You can run the command using Cards.hello

You can call function with/without parenthesis

Elixir has implicit return, which means Whenever a method or function runs whatever the last value inside that function is will automatically get returned. So I could have just as easily said Return Hi there or I could just left it off.
