# Cards

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/cards](https://hexdocs.pm/cards).

Elixir is a purely functional programming language

#### A module is a collection of different methods or functions

To run an elixir file : use command: iex -S mix (iex - interactive elixir shell)

You can run the command using Cards.hello

You can call function with/without parenthesis

Elixir has implicit return, which means Whenever a method or function runs whatever the last value inside that function is will automatically get returned. So I could have just as easily said Return Hi there or I could just left it off.

Lists:
01:09.920 --> 01:15.920
We can define a list of elements by using the bracket notation for an array which is similar to Ruby

01:15.950 --> 01:17.530
javascript Java.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.680
Tons of other languages.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.860
So again nothing too bad here just yet we can create our array or our list as the term we are using

01:24.860 --> 01:25.540
a lot.

01:25.670 --> 01:31.190
After placing these square braces so directly in here we can put in a first couple of cards as just

01:31.190 --> 01:37.010
strings like is two and three.

01:37.010 --> 01:41.860
Notice I'm using double quotes in here as opposed to single quotes, They are are supported, but double quotes are convention,

Recompile: Elixir runtime cannot automatically check for and build changes in the code, it has to be done manually by the command "recompile"

Object Oriented vs Functional Programming:
Diff 1:

![Object Oriented concept](media/cards_oo.png)

In OO approach, we have an instance of a class, with some moethods, which operate on its local instance variable.
