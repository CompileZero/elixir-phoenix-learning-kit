### What is Phoenix?

Phoenix's job is to behave as a web-server
It communicates with a database and can also communicate with HTML, JSON & Web Sockets
![phoenix](media/phoe1.png)

Database: Traditionally used PostgreSQL, but can use anything (MySQL, SQLite, MongoDb)

#### How phoenix handles incoming requests?

Look at our previous project in Elixir to create an identicon!
![identicon](media/ident.png)

The exact same steps will be followed to handle an HTTP Request

## Create a new project in Phoenix

``` elixir
> mix phx.new discuss
```

Here `mix` is a build tool, `phx.new` command creates a new phoenix project (Earlier, it was phoenix.new), `discuss` is the name of the project.

### The app that we are building

![The Project we are building](media/08-53-21.png)

A Forum kind of a project! Where users sign-up to the forum with `Github` (using O-Auth), they can post anything that serves as a topic of discussion, They can create a topic, and other users can comment on it. (Imagine like a reddit clone)

#### First Steps:

The first command would be `mix ecto.create`

This command will create the PostGres database for out Project.

At first you may get an error message like this

``` bash
atharvakulkarni@Atharvas-MacBook-Pro discuss (master)]$ mix ecto.create
Compiling 14 files (.ex)
Generated discuss app

09:01:09.385 [error] GenServer #PID<0.375.0> terminating
** (DBConnection.ConnectionError) tcp connect (localhost:5432): connection refused - :econnrefused
    (db_connection 2.2.2) lib/db_connection/connection.ex:87: DBConnection.Connection.connect/2
    (connection 1.0.4) lib/connection.ex:622: Connection.enter_connect/5
    (stdlib 3.13) proc_lib.erl:226: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3
Last message: nil
State: Postgrex.Protocol
** (Mix) The database for Discuss.Repo couldn't be created: killed
```

This is because the username and password does not seem to match for our PostGres Database.

#### How to solve the PostGres Connection Refused Error (Phoenix Project)

To solve this issue, go to the dev.exs file in `*your project name (discuss)*/config/**dev.exs**`
![Dev.exs Configuration File](media/09-08-31.png)

Here, most likely, your username value would show `postgres`. This is the default username provided by postgres and we don't want to use that.

``` bash
> whoami
atharvakulkarni
```

1. In your terminal, type the command `whoami`, you will receive your username, paste it in the `username` field in the `dev.exs` folder.
2. Run the `mix ecto.create`

``` bash
> mix ecto.create
Compiling 14 files (.ex)
Generated discuss app
The database for Discuss.Repo has been created
```

#### Starting the phoenix LiveServer

1. Execute in Terminal : `mix phx.server`
2. It starts the server at `localhost:4000`
3. You will be displayed with a nice welcome screen

#### Server Side Templating vs SPA in Phoenix

![Server Side Templating vs SPA](media/20-28-57.png)

Phoenix supports both the types, initially we start with Server Side Templating, and later on, as we deep-dive into Phoenix, we can head over to SPA kind of an architecture.

The main difference between SSR and SPA is that, whenever the user performs any action, a fresh HTTP request is sent to the server, whereas in SPA, the client (User's Web browser) already loads the entire HTML Document from the server, so when a link is clicked, it does not send a fresh HTTP Request to the server.

#### Setting up Material Design in Phoenix

Head over to [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html), and copy the CSS CDN. We won't be needing JS CDN in this project.

Head over to `projects/3-phoenix-list/discuss/lib/discuss_web/templates/layout` and in the `app.html.eex` page, paste the CDN link.

Run the project by the command [`mix phx.server`](#starting-the-phoenix-liveserver)

üí° Tip: Make sure you have PostGres SQL running on your machine, otherwise you may see a lot of errors in your terminal.

### MVC in Phoenix

To Understand the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Paradigm, let us consider an analogy:

You want to summarise the process of making muffins to someone else. There are essentially 3 components involved:

1. The batter itself which is the raw material required to produce muffins
2. A muffin tray, which puts the batter in a very distinctive shape and size.
3. A cook, who puts the batter in the muffin tray.

Similarly, while generating a web page like the following:

![Generating a web Page](media/20-49-14.png)

##### The following components are involved in the process:

![Model-View-Controller Explanation](media/20-49-48.png)

Similar to the previous analogy:

![MVC with Analogy](media/20-50-44.png)

üí° The controller (Cook) looks out for a particular data required, for Example : "My Customer requires Blueberry Muffins, so I'm going to make Blueberry Muffins!", Similiarly the controller knows what kind of data the user wants on the UI, and hence takes that particular data from the Model.

üåü MVC Architecture is not limited to Object Oriented Programming! It can also be applied to Functional Programming paradigm and pretty much any other programming paradigm.

#### What happens when the User makes a request (HTTP, JSON, image, media) to the application

![HTTP Request for Phoenix](media/21-05-24.png)

#### Controller & Router

In the router.ex

``` elixir
scope "/", DiscussWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end
```

The above code just means

> whenever we make a request for the index page (Eg: localhost:4000 <=> localhost:4000/ )
> activate the controller called as `PageController`

Now, `PageController` is a module defined in the¬†`projects/3-phoenix-list/discuss/lib/discuss_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`

### What happens in the `page_controller.ex` 

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "index.html")
  end

```

The `render` function renders the `index.html` file along with data in the `conn` object.
